# Swarm Masternodes Fund

## Description of the proposed change to Swarm Network Policy
Vote YES or NO to approve or disapprove of the entire GAP. If YES, then Multi-Option choices are below.

Adjusting the masternodes staking contracts. From every monthly payment to each node, a chosen % can be automatically sent to a secure wallet over the course of:

A) 3 years;

B) 5 years;

from its inception date, at the percentage rate of:

A) 12.5%;

B) 10%;

C) 5% + 2.5% for each following year; (5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%. 15% will always be the max, regardless of the duration of this initiative.)

The cost will only be for the small technical implementation on the Masternodes Page and backend, which can be done in-house. 


Data available clearly at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zx5krx-mPaxVYQsyusGHkbWDYWIdCS5c2EUyV9h-gLU/edit?usp=sharing


Despite the number of nodes possibly changing with time, you can see that the percentage of yearly rewards set aside for the Swarm Masternodes Fund is expected to remain fixed at the chosen rate for the chosen amount of time, as it is simply a percentage of the pool being paid out.

Any of the above rules and timeline can be amended in the future by a new GAP.


If this GAP is agreed upon, the Swarm Foundation commits to implement the changes and start the Swarm Masternodes Fund by the end of April 2020, and no later than the end of May 2020.

It will also require the creation of a multisig Ethereum address administered and protected by the Swarm Foundation. It will need at least 3 signatures or a similarly secure protection in accordance to the Swarm Foundation’s own standards. The community will be made aware of the identity of those Council members holding the signatures to access the Swarm Masternodes Fund. 

A new GAP in the future will aim to create a (Aragon) DAO that will vote on how to deploy the funds.

A new metric will be inserted in the Masternodes page, showing the Fund’s current balance. (https://masternodes.swarm.fund/#/) (implementation time to be discussed)

This particular GAP only focuses on approving its creation and a few basic rules to begin saving as soon as possible. 

New GAPs to improve the Swarm Masternodes Fund are welcome. 

## Purpose and rationale for the policy change and its intended outcomes
Each node will only contribute barely 2000 SWM tokens (very likely less) across the total 5-year period, in order to save up to 700,000+ SWM overall.

Through a new GAP, the Swarm Masternodes Fund could keep a number of MNs running until the Swarm Network will decide on ways to deploy the funds or rabalance it with other cryptocurrencies. 

The Swarm Masternodes Fund would foster a climate of collaboration between members, nurturing engagement and the discussion of ideas enriching the network’s strength, development and reach.

The Swarm Network can keep track of each payment to the Swarm Masternodes Fund return available tokens to their original Ethereum wallets, if the Fund was to be cancelled by any future GAP.

I would like to remind you that the goal of masternodes isn’t to only receive decreasing yearly rewards, but to process an increasing number of MAP (Market Access Protocol) transactions, so I find it very beneficial in the long-term to begin saving a few SWM tokens independent from the Swarm Treasury itself, with the goal of fostering adoption, utility and development.
