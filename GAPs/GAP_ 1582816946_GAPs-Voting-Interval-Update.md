# Council Seats Upgrade

## Description of the proposed change to Swarm Network Policy

This GAP proposes the following changes to the Swarm Network Constitution: Amend section "VII. Governance Action Voting Process" Subsection "B" Point "3".

It currently reads: "At a fixed interval of TWO MONTHS (the “Voting Interval”) the GABs in the Voting Queue with the five greatest GAB stakes are elevated for a referendum. The GAB stakes associated with elevated GABs are locked for fifteen (15) days and then returned to the Ballot Sponsors and Ballot Supporters." 

Proposed change: "At a fixed interval of TWO WEEKS (the “Voting Interval”) the GABs in the Voting Queue with the three greatest GAB stakes are elevated for a referendum. The GAB stakes associated with elevated GABs are locked for fifteen (15) days and then returned to the Ballot Sponsors and Ballot Supporters." 

In short, the change is to modify the "Voting Interval" from 2 months to 2 weeks.


## Purpose and rationale for the policy change and its intended outcomes

Many Swarm Network members feel important GAPs would take too long if voting takes place on a bi-monthly basis. 
I propose to turn it into a bi-weekly event to be able to quickly vote on essential changes or proposals in a fast-paced environment such a that of cryptocurrencies.

## Identify the specific uses for which any Swarm Treasury funds may be expended to support the Governance Action;

This proposal has no request for funds associated with it.
