## Swarm Governance Action Proposals

This repository contains all submitted Swarm Governance Action Proposals (GAPs).

Submit a draft proposal by creating a new file. Give your proposal a temporary name in the following format:

GAP_[NAME]_[CURRENT_EPOCH_TIME]

Current Epoch Time may be obtained from https://www.epochconverter.com

Elevated GAPs - the five most supported ballots by staked amount - will be copied to the Governance Action Ballot (GAB) repository, and scheduled for voting in a referendum. A referendum is held every two months.
