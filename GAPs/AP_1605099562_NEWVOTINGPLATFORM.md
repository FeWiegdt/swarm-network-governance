# Moving to new voting platform snapshot

## Description of the proposed Governance Action
Moving to new voting platform located at https://snapshot.page/#/swarm
## Purpose and rationale for the Governance Action and its intended outcomes
The current voting platform requires gas fees, it is a bit complicated to start votes, and it can be a bit buggy. This new platform will eliminate gas fees and provide an overall better voting experience.
## Identify the specific uses for which Swarm Treasury funds may be expended to support the Governance Action;

No funds required.

## Additional information for Governance Actions requiring the expenditure of Swarm Treasury funds
The new platform will not be able to include the Default Masternode Delegation in section H of the constitution: https://github.com/swarmfund/swarm-network-governance/blob/master/swarm_network_constitution/SNC-2019.02.pdf 2 So the constitution will need to be amended with this section H discarded.
