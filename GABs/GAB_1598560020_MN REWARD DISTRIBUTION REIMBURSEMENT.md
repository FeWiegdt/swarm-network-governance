# MN REWARD DISTRIBUTION REIMBURSEMENT

## Description of the proposed Governance Action
Reimburse council for out of pocket gas expenses for MN reward distribution. 
## Purpose and rationale for the Governance Action and its intended outcomes
Gas for MN reward distribution has become very expensive. Since the start, it was about $60 per month and the person doing it at the time was just paying out of pocket. Now it costs over $300 per month and that is a lot. 
## Identify the specific uses for which Swarm Treasury funds may be expended to support the Governance Action;

Requesting that the person who is paying the cost will be reimbursed in $SWM rounded up to the nearest cent in USD, not to be sold for at least 12 months. So for instance today, $0.04 

There are other ways to do distribution, but that requires work from developers and that expense will far exceed the high gas costs for the next 12 months. We can always submit another GAP if the community thinks we need to adjust.

## Additional information for Governance Actions requiring the expenditure of Swarm Treasury funds
- We can post the transaction in the community forum monthly so everyone sees it, along with the amount of $SWM transferred.
