# Swarm Network Policy - Modified Issuance Staking by Swarm_Council exception 

On July 1, the GAB on the SwarmNetworkPolicy for Issuance Staking was decided upon, which laid out the SWM staking requirements for different levels of tokenized value on the Swarm Network.

As the infrastructure is being built out and starting to be adopted, there are different segments of the issuer market for which the stated staking requirements and mechanisms might not fit.

We will need to trial with these issuers to find the best approach and level of staking that works within their business models, so that using the Swarm infrastructure remains attractive and compelling.

We propose a Swarm Network Policy to establish a process by which token issuers can approach the Swarm Council with requests to deviate from the general policy.

In consideration, the Council should review the business and market requirements and be guided by the balance of the adoption the Swarm network infrastructure as well as expanding the utility of the SWM token. Any granted exception should be documented in the Swarm network governance repository. 

The discovery process and the exceptions over time should lead to further insights on how to adapt the Issuance Staking Network Policy in general. 

No budget requested for the implementation of this GAP.
