# Decision from Swarm Council
Date: January 4, 2021, 1609796795
In attendance: Zak Perryman, Richard Steward, Alex Cornwell

## Decisions taken

### Review of Request by Swarm Capital regarding staking credits

* Swarm Capital (SC) voluntarily had committed to put 2,848,59 SWM of the tokens into a pool used for staking credits.
* The tokens are in the Swarm Council governed multisignature wallet: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3c8e177699560622b051dadeee2ce4b3264a16c3#tokentxns 
* SC is now planning to launch and distribute a pre-mined digital security for an asset at a total value of €7.5M
* The corresponding current stake is SWM 2,608,508 (tokenized asset value of €7.5M (= $9.06M) @0.40% staking rate -> $36.3K stake in USD @0.013916). Therefore SC will use the staking credits directly against that.
* SC is requesting to review above and release the staking credit amounts (2,848,59 SWM) back into the originating wallet 0x3f915Ae4473F26740e1Af3017ebe35B69DcD2803, to start processing the described issuance

### Approval of Staking Credits for Swarm Capital

The Swarm Council has reviewed and granted the request and will execute the transfer.
