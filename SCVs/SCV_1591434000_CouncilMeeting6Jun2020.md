## Decisions taken

### Review of Deliverables and Agreement between Swarm Foundation and Swarm Capital

* The Swarm Council has reviewed the singed Agreement between Swarm Foundation, LI and Swarm Capital GmbH (SC) dated 1/29/2020, with the file hash (sha256-32) 8DC0C5F195DCFA6C089087E56C91161924A3F08CEB4C2FE31E99FFC55F0CEAAB
* The Swarm Council confirms that it properly reflects the decisions taken via GAB_1568394000 and additional voluntarily commitments made
* As a result:
  * A full technology transfer of specified items (incl. compliant contracts, SRC20 contracts and fundraising contracts) has been made to the Swarm Foundation and subsequently open-sourced, available at https://github.com/swarmfund
  * SWM 2,848,596 of the awarded SWM token grants are to be used against issuer staking amounts (“Staking Credits”). These tokens have been  deposited in a dedicated multi-signature wallet at 0x3C8e177699560622B051DADEEE2CE4B3264a16C3, over which the SC has governance.
* SWM 2,247,310 SWM of the awarded SWM token grants have been sent to an unadministered smart contract at 0x6c8adf556884289038c29bcafc457e4910b41a3f, which are linearly released to Swarm Capital over the course of 12 months starting with the adoption of the GAB (“Release Tokens").

### Approval of Staking Credits for Swarm Capital

SC has requested to use staking credits for a customer who is pre-mining a digital security for a financial product at a total value of €7.5M, to then later transact with other investors privately on those tokens. The corresponding stake based on current metrics is SWM 3,665,657 (tokenized asset value of €7.5M (= $8.5M) @0.40% staking rate -> $33.9K Stake in USD @
$0.009248). Exact amount to be determined and coordinated with the Swarm Council at the time of calling stake-to-mint(). The Swarm Council has reviewed and granted the request.
