# Proposals

A proposal starts as an idea that originates in the Swarm community. If it is felt there is enough ‘backing’ for the proposal, any Member can initiate a “Governance Action Proposal” or “GAP”, providing a detailed description of the action, any relevant supporting documentation, and may include a request for a budget. A GAP should describe to Members how the action benefits the Swarm Network and why they should vote for it.

There are four themes that a GAP may be categorized into:

1. Network Constitution: proposals suggesting changes to the Swarm Network Constitution,
2. Network Policy: proposals for changes to core network policies such as staking requirements, rewards, etc,
3. Proclamation: proposals for making a public statement on behalf of the Swarm Network,
4. General: all other governance action proposals.

Proposal templates may be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/templates).
