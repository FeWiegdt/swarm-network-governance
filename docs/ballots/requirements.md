# Ballot Proposal Process

## Instructions:

When you're ready to create a proposal, use the following procedures to submit your draft by creating a pull request in GitHub.

1. Use a template to ensure your proposal includes all the required information.
   1. [ ] Click the [template](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/templates) that relates to the proposal you are submitting,
   2. [ ] To copy the template, click **Raw**, then copy the contents of the template to use in your proposal in the next step.  
2. Submit your draft proposal:
   1. [ ] In the [GAPs](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/GAPs) repository, **create a new file**.
   2. [ ] Name your proposal with a temporary name that includes a description and timestamp.
   3. [ ] Paste the contents of the template from Step 1 into your file and complete all the information.
   4. [ ] Click "**Propose new file**" to review your submission and click "**Create pull request**" to continue.
   5. [ ] Add any notes or instructions, then click "**Create pull request**" again.
3. Stake 250 SWM to make your proposal eligible for balloting.
   1. [ ] An editor will reply to your request, providing an address to stake at least 250 SWM.
   2. [ ] Deposit your stake and provide the TransactionID for verification.
4. Verified proposals will be merged and visible in the [GAPs](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/GAPs) repository.
5. Any Swarm Member may improve the likelihood of the GAP being balloted by staking an additional amount of SWM, in increments of at least 250.
6. Every two months, the five most supported GAPs - by staked amount - will be elevated to a Governance Action Ballot \(GAB\) and scheduled for voting in the next referendum. 
7. Approved GABs are placed in the [Governance Actions](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/Governance%20Actions) repository and enacted.
8. Stakes associated with winning GABs are locked for two months after their vote, and then returned to the Ballot Sponsors and Ballot Supporters. The stakes of any failed GABs are forfeited to the Swarm Treasury.

## Requirements:

A proposal must:

* concisely and cogently describe the Governance Action;
* describe the purpose and rationale for the Governance Action and its intended outcomes;
* identify the specific uses for which Swarm Treasury funds may be expended to support the Governance Action;
* be written in English; and
* specify the Voting Period

If a Governance Action requires the expenditure of Swarm Treasury funds the proposal must, in addition: articulate and establish an accountability framework that measures the performance of the Governance Action; provide an auditing procedure to account for expenditures; and provide a method for reporting the audit and performance results to the Swarm Network and the Swarm Council.
